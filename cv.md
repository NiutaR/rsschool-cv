### About Me
At a certain point in my life, I realized that I wanted an interesting, promising work in which I could reveal my creative and logical potential. Actually, that's why I chose Front-end development. I want to become part of interesting projects that will simplify and improve human life.

In my free time from studies I spend reading books, watching movies, painting.
